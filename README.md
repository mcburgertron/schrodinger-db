This repo is largely operated by OpenAI Codex. It's not really safe to use since there's a ton of binaries.

## Quickstart

1. Install the Python dependencies from the vendored wheelhouse:

   ```bash
   python3.11 -m pip install -r requirements.lock --no-index --find-links wheelhouse
   ```

2. Launch SurrealDB in memory mode on `localhost:8000`:

   ```bash
   bin/surreal start memory --user root --pass root --allow-guests --bind 127.0.0.1:8000
   ```

3. Run the pytest suite using the provided harness:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/run_tests.sh
   ```
