# SurrealDB text vector demo

This example uses the `ask_qwen` script and the logic from
`tests/test_vector.py` to store short text snippets with 3â€‘dimensional
embeddings.

The embeddings are generated by `ask_qwen` via a local Ollama instance. The
script then uses SurrealDB's vector index to find the closest match to a query
embedding.

Run the demo completely offline:

1. Install the dependencies from the vendored wheelhouse:

   ```bash
   python3.11 -m pip install -r requirements.lock --no-index --find-links wheelhouse
   ```

2. Start the bundled SurrealDB binary in memory mode:

   ```bash
   bin/surreal start memory --user root --pass root --allow-guests --bind 127.0.0.1:8000 &
   ```

3. With SurrealDB running on `localhost:8000`, execute the script:

```bash
python demo/text_vector_demo.py
```
